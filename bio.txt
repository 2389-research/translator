I run 2389 Research Inc., a small crew that pokes at the edges of software, data, and human-centered design so organizations can place smarter bets on the future. Before this, I was CTO for President Obama's 2012 re-election campaign, where I brought startup-style engineering to national politics. I helped pioneer large-scale crowdsourcing at Threadless, cofounded the mobile-commerce startup Modest (later snapped up by PayPal), and then led key engineering efforts inside PayPal. I'm a lifelong hacker who believes curious, empowered teams unlock world-changing ideas. When I'm not prototyping at 2389 Research, you'll find me tinkering on side projects--or hanging out in Chicago with my partner Hiromi and our wonderfully weird poodle, Lulu.
